# Numerical-Analysis-Algorithms-Python-2-

### This is the second part of a Python project that I made in my third semester of studies. <br> It implements various Numerical Analysis Algorithms in Python.

#### Fifth Exercise:
This file contains the implementation of three different functions used to interpolate Sin(x). <br>
The algorithms that I used are polynomial approach, Splines interpolation and Least Squares. <br>
The program is able to produce the approximation of Sin(x) for any given X.

#### Sixth Exercise:
This Python file contains the implementation of two similar methods used to calculate the approximation of an integral given a start and an end point.
These two are Simpson method and Trapezoidal method.

#### Seventh Exercise:
In this Python file I am using the Least Squares method to predict the value of closing days in the Greek stock exhange.
I am using three different Least Square models each one giving different approximations.
